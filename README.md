# The GNU Car project

**Proposed by:** [`@seanpm2001`](https://github.com/seanpm2001/)

[Logo coming soon](#Logo)

**Legal disclaimer:** As it currently stands, this project is not endorsed by, or affiliated with the GNU project or the Free Software Foundation, but I would really like it to be, and I will donate this project to them upon their request, provided they can care for and advance the project and eventually achieve the goal.

## Reasoning

All current electric cars are powered by non-free software. I want a car that does not have any Google, Apple, Tesla, or other proprietary bits in it. I want a completely GNU car, made up entirely of free, libre, and open source software. This is the biggest barrier for why I can't start driving yet.

As of 2023, Thursday February 16th, there is not a single car on the market that meets this goal.

## Guidelines

- The software design of the car MUST follow the [`GNU Philosophy`](https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/philosophy.html) there cannot be a single bit and/or byte of proprietary software in the cars system.
- The car must be licensed under one or more of the following licenses: GPL2, GPL3, LGPL2, LGPL3, AGPL2, or AGPL3. No other licenses are permitted.

## Candidate systems

Operating system candidates include:

- [Trisquel Linux](https://trisquel.info/) (A certified GNU/Linux operating system)
- Other (list one here)

## Other

### Rejected names

The following names were rejected:

- **GNU Mobile** - Reason: Sounds like a mobile operating system project, rather than an automobile system project.
- **No other rejected names**

### Logo

This project does not yet have a logo. The community can decide on one when needed.

### Development

I cannot personally develop the car myself, I have a rule where I can't develop my own automobile software, as I already have too many projects I am working on, and I left this open for others. I can still contribute to existing automobile software, however.

### Hardware

The hardware this software will run on is still a major decision that needs to be made. Flashing an existing car may not be feasible, and producing new hardware may prove to be difficult.

### Competitors

A non-exhaustive list of competitors to this project.

- Google LLCÂ§Android Auto
- Tesla Inc.
- Other/unlisted

> **Note** None of the listed competitors are producing GNU systems in their vehicles.
